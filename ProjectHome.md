### This site serves as the central repository for both code and discussion around the open source project responsible for creating the NPR News application on Android. ###

If you are interested in joining the group, here are several ways you can get involved:

  * Code contributions - If you have the chops to help us with actual code, we'd love to work together. We have a review process in place, so please communicate that you'd like to tackle something specific before sending a review around.
  * Bug tracking - Keep seeing a reproducible error? Or even better, have log files of the problem? Vent your frustration! Create a new issue or comment on an existing thread. Please, try to avoid duplicates. The more specific about what device & carrier, flavor of the OS (1.6, 2.2, gingerbread, etc), and version of the app itself the better.
  * UX/UI & Feature discussion - We also value input on the design and functionality of the app. While we are always open to suggestion, understand even if we all agree something might be cool to do, we always have to prioritize.

You can also chat on Twitter with @nprandroid or by sending a note to jpennycook {at} npr {dot} org.
